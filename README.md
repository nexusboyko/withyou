(Always) with you.


Started out as a small demo for the "Universal Wellness" track @ UW's 2024 DubHacks.

Now it's a small desktop "widget" that includes a collection of little tools and features (wip).

Why did I make it? I wanted a digital companion that could float around and be accessed when needed. Take a small note of something, run a Pomadoro timer, and the list goes on... More importantly, though, it's meant to always be there for you without having to jump between windows or finding new apps.

What makes it special? Think of it as somewhere between a web browser extension and a desktop applicationâ€”it's meant to be small, while still being interactive and useful.
